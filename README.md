# Donar-Prediction-Web-App

Donar Prediction Using Income Level is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of finding a donor based on their income level. 
The application utilizes an XGBoost model trained on a dataset of income data to make predictions.

## How to Use
When you access the web application, you will see a sidebar with two options: "Home" and "About."

Select "Home" to go to the prediction page.

On the prediction page, you need to provide the following information to predict the income level:

* Age: Slide the age bar to select your age.
* Workclass: Select your workclass from the dropdown list.
* Education Level: Select your highest education level from the dropdown list.
* Education Number: Slide the education number bar to indicate your level of education.
* Marital Status: Select your marital status from the dropdown list.
* Occupation: Select your occupation from the dropdown list.
* Relationship: Select your relationship status from the dropdown list.
* Race: Select your race from the dropdown list.
* Sex: Select your gender from the dropdown list.
* Capital Gain: Enter your capital gain.
* Capital Loss: Enter your capital loss.
* Hours per Week: Slide the hours per week bar to indicate the number of hours you work per week.
* Native Country: Select your native country from the dropdown list.
* After providing the required information, click on the "Predict" button.

The application will process your input and display the prediction result as "Income Level: Greater than 50K" if the model predicts a higher income level or "Income Level: Less than or equal to 50K" if the model predicts a lower income level.
